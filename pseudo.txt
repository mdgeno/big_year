-ask the user for input '?'

-the program recognises the below commands;
	add 	- adds a bird, then proceeds to;
		- ask user to input 'Name: '
		- ask user to input 'Name in Latin: '

		-take in the name inputs and create a bird object
			then store it in the bird array.

	spotted - adds a sighting
		- if not in database of birds, the program then
			outputs 'Not a bird!'		

	all 	- prints all birds
		- outputs all birds and displays information
			'NameOfBird (Latin Name): number of sightings

	one 	- prints one bird
		- asks the user 'Bird?', takes in the string value
			representing the name of the bird.
		- then outputs the full information of the 
			single bird which the name was entered.
			(format the same from All command)
		
	quit - ends the program

-struct BirdArray
	array: [Bird; 5]
	
	impl BirdArray
		add
		one
		all
 
+

-struct Bird
	name: 
	name in latin
	mut sighting
	
	impl Bird
		print

OR 

-enum BirdDatabase
	Bird{ name:
	      latin_name:
	      sighting:
	    }
	BirdArray{array: [Bird; 5]} or??
	BirdArray([Bird; 5])

	impl BirdDatabase
		add
		one
		all
		spotted

??

CONTINUE HERE!!
-So an array of Bird objects is possible. We now just have to find
a way to create a series of Bird objs through a loop construct,
and simultaneously store it in the array of Bird objs.

LATEST CONCLUSION
-It is very difficult for my current level to be able to code a 
concept of a database for birds. My knowledge is currently limited
to only tuples and arrays for collections constructs. I've researched
for solutions, work arounds, and it has always been advised to use
vecotrs for these types of scenarios, which I will be tackling on
very soon.
-The limitations I came to realise are that arrays have a fixed
size, although I compromised with proceeding with an array length
of 5 values.
-Another limitation is creating an Array of objects. When
instantiating an array, it is necessary that there be values filled
in each index, for instance an array of integers need to have atleast
0s althrough out the index to represent an empty array. The 
limitation is that creating an empty array of Bird objects is
somewhat not doable as the program handles different commands during
runtime and adding a bird obj in to the array is only one of them.
Therefore, an array with empty slots is really necessary to 
satisfy the required features of the program.
-I shall resume this program as soon as I have gained the vector
ability.
